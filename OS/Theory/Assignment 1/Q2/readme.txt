Assalam-o-Alaikum!
For this question, you just have to run the program to see its execution
In the instruction, we were required to make 2 sample programs.
so i just saved the instructions in an array and i just commented one array, so u can run it after uncommenting that one.
and opcodes are in an enum
and i just made a memory of 20 spaces, so yeah
Thanks for Reading
