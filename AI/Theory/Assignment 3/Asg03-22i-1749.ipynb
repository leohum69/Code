    "# Assignment 3 - Exams Schedule Generator Using Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This Assignment implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate an optimal examination schedule for a university. The algorithm ensures that scheduling constraints are met while optimizing certain preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Reads input data from provided Excel files.\n",
    "- Implements a Genetic Algorithm from scratch using only `numpy` and `pandas`.\n",
    "- Uses **tournament_selection** for chromosome selection.\n",
    "- Supports **One point** crossover technique.\n",
    "- Applies penalties for constraint violations and rewards for optimization criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fitness Function\n",
    "The fitness function evaluates schedules based on:\n",
    "### **Hard Constraints (Must be Satisfied)**\n",
    "- Every course must have an exam scheduled.\n",
    "- No student should have overlapping exams.\n",
    "- Exams are only scheduled from Monday to Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM.\n",
    "- Each exam must have an invigilating teacher.\n",
    "- No teacher is assigned to multiple exams at the same time.\n",
    "- No teacher is assigned consecutive exam invigilation duties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Soft Constraints (Optimization Criteria)**\n",
    "- A common break on Friday from 1–2 PM.\n",
    "- Avoiding back-to-back exams for students.\n",
    "- Preferably scheduling Management (MG) exams before Computer Science (CS) exams.\n",
    "- Two-hour break in a week for faculty meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "The final output should:\n",
    "- Show The best Fitness accoridng to the Generation.\n",
    "- Display a final valid schedule satisfying all hard constraints and at least 3 soft constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Code\n",
    "Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run the notebook or execute the script to generate the exam schedule.\n",
